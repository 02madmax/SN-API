# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

The premise of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create a custom API for a social network web application. This website demonstrates the use of post, get, delete, and put routes within two different controllers plus an extra reaction schema that is tied into the thoughts controller. We learned how to use express.js with a MongoDB database.

## Tests

To test using Insomnia, you will need to add the end points of each route to your localhost:3001/ port.
Here are some example endpoints you can use: localhost:3001/api/users, localhost:3001/api/users/1, localhost:3001/api/thoughts, localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid, localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid/reactions, localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtid/reactions/reactionid. Some endpoints may need to be modified to suit the needs of the user.
